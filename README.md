# Hybrid  Recommender System

This project is a **hybrid recommender system** that suggests **movies, anime, and video games** using a combination of **content-based filtering** (TF-IDF + cosine similarity) and **popularity metrics** (engagement, reviews, audience size).  

It was built as part of my **Data Research Analyst internship at Cooledtured**, where I worked with over **170,000+ rows of data** across multiple APIs and integrated them with **Google Sheets + Python pipelines**

##  Features
- Scraped and processed **170,000+ rows** of data from **movies, anime, and video games** APIs.
- Built a hybrid recommender: TF-IDF similarity + popularity (owners, reviews, peak players).
- Implemented an **interactive Gradio dashboard** to explore recommendations.
- Integrated **Google Sheets** for collaborative data storage and updates.
- Managed **data pipelines**: collection → processing → model → dashboard.
