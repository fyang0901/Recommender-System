We keep reviewing and seeking out the motives of criminals, exploring the subtlest emotions driving them. It’s not to put ourselves in their shoes and sympathize, or even forgive them; it’s not to find some reasons to exculpate their crimes; it’s not to kneel down before the so-called ""complexity of human nature""; nor to introspect social conflicts, much less to alienate ourselves into monsters.

Only a chosen few with exceptional magical talent are admitted into the school, so it is a mystery how a human with no magic ability ended up here.

Although Yuu desires to return home, it is easier said than done. While the school's headmaster searches for a way to send him back, Yuu is assigned manual labor around the campus. But due to the chaos at the school's entrance ceremony following his arrival, Yuu has a target painted on his back as far as Heartslabyul dorm leader Riddle Rosehearts is concerned.

Yuu meets and befriends Heartslabyul freshmen Ace Trappola and Deuce Spade; yet soon after, Ace and Deuce land in a situation that results in their expulsion. As the pair seek to redeem themselves, Yuu accompanies them on their perilous mission to fix school property. However, forgiveness does not come easily from the ""Crimson Tyrant"" in charge of Heartslabyul, who may have an ulterior motive behind his strictness.

First-year high school student Uta Komaki loves to sing, but she's extremely shy, timid, and a bit of a coward. She wants to join the light music club for her high school debut, but she's too intimidated by the dazzling presence of the members to submit her application. In her moment of despair, she receives an invitation to join the a cappella club from the president, Airi Kojou...

The a cappella club is filled with unique individuals—some might say they're a bit odd. Even if they're not flashy or popular, there's a special kind of youth that connects through their voices, creating something truly unique.

Awajima Musical School Training Camp, dubbed the ""boarding house,"" is where young girls gather from all over Japan to perform on stage. Tabata Wakana aspires to be a musical star; housemaster Takehara Kinue attends to carry on her best friend's wishes; beautiful Okabe Emi is a scholarship student who is always at the center of attention; and Ibuki Katsurako, who became a teacher at the school though originally from a family of actresses.

The unique environment of the musical school is simultaneously a respite space for these aspiring girls and also a harsh battleground that pits young students against each other. It is a place where perseverance can lead to blossoming talents, but also to a cruel reality at times. The clear depiction and psychological portrayal allow the subtle inner workings of each character to come through.

However, one family is exempt from this generalization: House Grail, whose main tenets are truth and integrity. The youngest daughter, Constance Grail, is just as moral as the rest of her family, believing in always doing the right thing and helping those in need.

However, these ideals do not help her when her fiancé cheats on her with another woman. Framed by his lover in the hope of her downfall, Constance's pleas for justice are ignored. Everyone turns a blind eye, save for one—the spirit of the infamous Scarlet Castiel—who possesses Constance and turns the tables on her accuser. However, this aid doesn't come without a price.

Ten years ago, Scarlet was executed for the attempted murder of Princess Cecilia. But this was actually a setup; as blunt and harsh as Scarlet could be, she would never stoop so low as to use poison. She has no idea who orchestrated her incrimination, but Scarlet demands that Constance—as the only one who can see her—help her exact revenge on all those who wronged her!

He is soon captivated by his classmate Kashiwada, a mysterious student who consistently wears a blank face. Oota conspires to break her placid demeanor through scares and mischievous schemes, though his tactics always seem to backfire.

Oota is known as the class clown and is constantly disciplined by his teacher, who claims ""his face gives it away."" To no fault of his own, he lacks control of his emotions and facial expressions. Kashiwada, on the other hand, seems perpetually emotionless and unreadable—no one knows what she is thinking!

Oota and Kashiwada are complete opposites, but that does not stop a unique relationship from developing between them. As they realize their feelings for each other, it raises an important question: do opposites really attract?
